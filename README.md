# Differential Gaussian Rasterization

Modified version of the rasterization engine for the paper "3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Rendering of Radiance Fields". This fork rasterizes 32 channels rather than 3.
If you can make use of it in your own research, please be so kind to cite the original work.
